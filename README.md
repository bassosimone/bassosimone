### Hi there! ðŸ™Œ

I'm Simone and I am a research engineer. Below is a short summary of my experience:

- âœ¨ Ten years of experience measuring internet performance and internet censorship.
- âœ¨ Wrote an maintained the network measurement engines used by [OONI](https://ooni.org/) in 2014-2024.
- âœ¨ Let the development of the next-generation Network Diagnostic Tool (ndt7) used by [M-Lab](https://measurementlab.net/).
- âœ¨ Led the development of the [Network neutrality bot](https://github.com/neubot/neubot) in 2010-2020.
- âœ¨ Worked at [OONI](https://ooni.org/) (2019-2024) and [Nexa Center](https://nexa.polito.it/) (2010-2017).
- âœ¨ [OTF](https://www.opentech.fund/) Information Controls Fellow in 2017-2018.
- âœ¨ Participated to the [TOP-IX](https://www.top-ix.org/) [BIG DIVE](https://github.com/bigdive) training program in 2015.
- âœ¨ PhD in computer science in 2014 at [POLITO](https://www.polito.it/) with [J.C. De Martin](https://demartin.polito.it/).
- âœ¨ Mentored several BSc, MEng, and GSoC students.

## Open-Source Projects

- [neubot/dash](https://github.com/neubot/dash): I still maintain this project, which implements a client and server for the Neubot [DASH streaming experiment](https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-021-dash.md).

- [ooni/probe-cli](https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli): I maintained and lead the development this repository (and the [OONI](https://ooni.org/) measurement engine written in Go) between 2019 and 2024.

- [bassosimone/websteps-illustrated](https://github.com/bassosimone/websteps-illustrated): I wrote this new experimental experiment for exploring improving websites blocking measurement techniques in 2022-2024 and incorporated core ideas into [OONI](https://ooni.org/) [Web Connectivity v0.5 experiment](https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/tree/v3.23.0/internal/experiment/webconnectivitylte).

- [measurement-kit/measurement-kit](https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit): I wrote and maintained this library between 2013 and 2020 to provide an [OONI](https://ooni.org/), [Neubot](https://github.com/neubot/neubot), and [NDTv5](https://github.com/ndt-project/ndt) measurement engine. Measurement Kit was used by OONI (in 2017-2020) as well as other integrators to perform network performance and internet censorship measurements.

- [m-lab/ndt-server](https://github.com/m-lab/ndt-server): I contributed to this repository in 2018-2020 to implement the next-generation Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) iteration, also known as [ndt7](https://github.com/m-lab/ndt-server/blob/v0.22.0/spec/ndt7-protocol.md).

- [neubot/neubot](https://github.com/neubot/neubot): I wrote this project as a doctoral student and maintained it between 2010 and 2020 (with most of the development and the related research papers happening in 2010-2014 during my doctorate).
