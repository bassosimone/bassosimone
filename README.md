### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simone and I am a research engineer.

Below is a short summary of my experience:

- âœ¨ Ten years of experience measuring internet performance and internet censorship.
- âœ¨ Wrote an maintained the network measurement engines used by [OONI](https://ooni.org/) in 2014-2024.
- âœ¨ Let the development of the next-generation Network Diagnostic Tool used by [M-Lab](https://measurementlab.net/).
- âœ¨ Led the development of the [Network neutrality bot](https://github.com/neubot/neubot).
- âœ¨ Worked at [OONI](https://ooni.org/) and [Nexa Center](https://nexa.polito.it/).
- âœ¨ [OTF](https://www.opentech.fund/) Information Controls Fellow in 2017-2018.
- âœ¨ Participated to the [TOP-IX](https://www.top-ix.org/) [BIG DIVE](https://github.com/bigdive) training program.

## Open-Source Projects

- [neubot/dash](https://github.com/neubot/dash)

I still maintain this project, which implements a client and server for the Neubot [DASH streaming experiment](https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-021-dash.md).

- [ooni/probe-cli](https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli)

I maintained and lead the development this repository (and the OONI measurement engine written in Go) between 2019 and 2024.

- [bassosimone/websteps-illustrated](https://github.com/bassosimone/websteps-illustrated)

I wrote this new experiment for measuring websites blocking in 2022-2024 and incorporated core ideas into [OONI](https://ooni.org/) Web Connectivity v0.5 experiment.

- [measurement-kit/measurement-kit](https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit)

I wrote and maintained this library between 2013 and 2020 to provide an OONI, Neubot, and NDT measurement engine. This engine was used by OONI
as well as other integrators to perform network performance and internet censorship measurements.

- [m-lab/ndt-server](https://github.com/m-lab/ndt-server)

I contributed to this repository in 2018-2020 to implement the next-generation Network Diagnostic Tool iteration, also known as ndt7.

- [neubot/neubot](https://github.com/neubot/neubot)

I wrote this project as a doctoral student and maintained it between 2010 and 2020 (with most of the development occurring in 2010-2014 during my doctorate).
